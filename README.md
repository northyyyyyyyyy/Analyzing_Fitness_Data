## Prepare Stage Summary (Bellabeat ‚Äì Leaf Product)
### Dataset Overview
This dataset is from [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), a public domain dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains personal fitness tracker data from 30 consented fitbit users. I will import this dataset into Bigquery where I will clean, process, and analyze the data.

### Scope & Limitations
- The dataset comes from 33 users. The sample size is not large enough to represent actual Fitbit users.
- The dataset contains data collected during a period of 2 months in 2016. This is outdated and the period is too short to recognize trends.
- There are limited metrics available in the dataset, for example sleep time, activity minutes, steps, and heart rate.
- The dataset contains no demographic information (e.g., sex, age). This data could be useful for understanding customers in each segment.
- Our scope of analysis can only be a prototype to find lifestyle routines that we assume come from general individuals.

### Dataset Classification
- Datasets come in 2 periods, 3/12/2016 - 4/11/2016 and 4/12/2016 - 5/12/2016 so we need to combine them into one for simpler work.
- Core datasets would be DailyActivities, SleepDay which will be used to analyze daily steps, activity minutes, calories, and hours asleep.
- Secondary datasets would be hourly data which will be used to identify patterns within a day
- WeightInfo is used for exploratory use due to limited records.

### Data Quality Considerations
- Duplicates: Remove exact duplicates in daily tables. If the same ID/date has different values (e.g., calories), use the average.
- Missing values: Drop missing rows if the dataset is sufficiently large; otherwise, keep to avoid losing user data.
- Outliers: Keep outliers, as extreme values may reflect real behavior (e.g., long cardio sessions).

### Key Insights & Recommendation
1. **Weekly Patterns ‚Äì Peak Activity on Mon, Wed, Sat**
- Users are most active on these days and sleep better on Wed & Sat.
- **Recommendation:** Schedule in-app challenges and push notifications aligned with these peak days, reinforcing healthy momentum when users are already more engaged.
2. **Calories Driven by Very Active Minutes**
- Calorie burn correlates strongly with very active minutes compared to other active levels. 
- **Recommendation:** Introduce intensity-based goals (e.g., ‚Äú20 min active activity‚Äù) to help users achieve better results and feel progress faster than with step-only goals. We could also provide support with follow-along workout videos or partnership with gyms encouraging users to participate in HIIT classes.
3. **Daily Routine Patterns ‚Äì Noon & Evening Activity Spikes**
- Users walk more during noon and after 6 pm which can be inferred to be lunch break and after work. 
- **Recommendation:** Send smart reminders during these windows (e.g., ‚ÄúTake a 5-min walk now to hit today‚Äôs goal‚Äù), aligning with natural routines rather than forcing new ones.
4. **Sedentary Lifestyle ‚Äì 80% of Time Inactive**
- Most users spend the majority of their day sedentary. There are gaps where we can encourage users to be more active.
- **Recommendation:** Launch a ‚ÄúBreak the Sedentary Cycle‚Äù campaign rewarding users for reducing long sitting periods (e.g., badges, loyalty points, or wellness gift rewards).
5. **Lack of weight information**
- Weight and BMI data can unlock highly personalized user goals. For example, an overweight user may benefit from weight-loss targets, while a normal-weight user may focus on performance goals such as preparing for a marathon.
- **Recommendation:** Require demographic details (e.g., age, sex, weight) during registration. Use these attributes to tailor goal-setting and connect users with similar profiles in a brand community.This not only increases personalization and motivation but also strengthens BellaBeat‚Äôs brand loyalty and supports organic growth through community referrals.
